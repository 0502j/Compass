##### Cyber Security



Information Security x Cyber Security

**Information security** - protecting data from various kinds of threats (on the internet or physical threats)

**Cyber security** - deal specifically with protecting data from cyber threats that exist on the internet.



✔ CIA - the pillars of Cyber Security

**Confidentiality** - data is accessed by only those with the right permit (encryption, passwords, biometrics, 2FA, MFA

**Integrity** - data has no been tampered or altered in any way (hashign, checksums).

**Availability** - data and resources available to be accessed or shared (network access, server)

❌ DAD

Disclosure - data is accessed by non-authorized users (trojans, brute force, theft)

Alteration - data has been compromised or tampered with (malware, viruses, SQL injection)

Deniability - access to data and resources are blocked (denial of service attacks, ransomware)



Cookies

A cookie is a text file that is placed on the computer whenever a site is visited. It allows the website to keep track of the visit details and store preferences. as well as increasing speed on the next visit and match ads according to interests / preferences.



TCP/IP Protocol

**Transmission Control Protocol -** Divides data into smaller packets that are transmitted over the internet and then reassembled when destination is reached.

**IP -** Internet Protocol, responsible for the address of each packet so it is sent to the corret destination



The 4 layers

Datalink - protocols that operate on a link that connect hosts on a network

Internet / Networking - connect independent networks together

Transport - handles communication between hosts

Application -  standardizes data exchange for applications



Uses of TCP/IP

- Internet

- Emails

- Playing games

  

Concepts

**Black Hat** - Financial interests

**Grey Hat** - Black hat tactics for White hat objectives

**Hacktivists** - Hacking for a cause

**Insider Threat** - Saboteur

**Passive Reconnaissance** - the only non-illegal step, gathering basic information (e-mail addresses, phone numbers, social media accounts, physical locations)

**Active Reconnaissance** - searching for vulnerabilities and weaknesses (IP addresses, DNS servers, open ports, usernames, passwords, company software)

**Exploitation** - taking advantage of a vulnerability to gain access (phishing mail, social engineering, unpatched software, weak passwords, malware injection)

**Privilege Escalation** - increasing the control over the exploited target (creating accounts, network hijack, admin access)

**Establish Persistence** - ensuring continuous access even aftehr the breach has been discovered by the victim

**Attack Phase** - data extraction, data corruption, malware injection

**Cover Up** - avoiding detection (clear event logs, erasing command history, icmp tunnels)



WhoIs Query - ICANN

Everytime a domain is registered it is necessary to provide information (phone number, address, e-mail), that are added to WhoIs data.



Social Enginering

Exploiting human emotions and interactions to extract valuable information.

**Baiting** - lure the target to taking an unfavorable action

**Pretexting** - looking, acting or sounding the part

**Quid Pro Quo** - offering a service in exchange for information

**Phishing** - relies on creating a sense of excitement or panic in the target using e-mails



Bruteforce Attack - BFA

A trial and error against passwords, checking all possible key combinations by the use of automated software to generate a large number of consecutive guesses

- Prevention: strong passwords, restrict login attempts, enforce timeout



Phishing

The attempt of obtaining sensitive data by sending crafted emails to a potential victim whilst impersonating a known person. It relies on naivety, curiosity and fear.

E-mail - e-mails sent with malicious links are sent in mass to as many email addresses as possible

Spear - phishing attack directed at a very specific target

Whaling - attack directed against senior executives

Vishing - phishing attack by phone calls

Smishing - phishing attack by text messages

- Prevention: training, security alertness, anti-malware software

  

DoS / DDoS

When the server is knocked out due too many requests to handle by one or thousands of computers. It will flood servers and networks with useless traffic until it becomes inaccessible.

- Prevention / Combating attacks: overprovision bandwidth, creating DDoS playbooks, being in contact with DDoS specialists

  

Pings

Network command used to know if a particular service is online.
