##### Introduction to Agile: Scrum and Kanban



###### What is Agile Method?

Is an iterative and incremental approach, which is carried out ina collaborative spirit with just the right amount of formalism.

The team will work iteratively and incrementally. It focuses on one sub goal at time and repeats this cycle until an objective is achieved.

Traditional approach:

Plan projects from A to Z â€”> Develop everything â€”> Validate everything â€”> Deliver the final product

- The traditional approach has no room for change and we take a risk of delivering a final product that does not meet the customerâ€™s expectations.

With Agile method:

First subproject â€”> Develop 1 or more functionalities â€”> Deliver to customer so they can provide feedback if needed

With Agile method, itâ€™s possible to adapt functionalities based on customerâ€™s feedback and priorities, since the product is not delivery all at once, being gradually shown instead.



###### How was Agile born?

In the 90s, IT projects often failed.

To increase success rate, in February 2001, 17 computer development specialists met in US. At that time, the agile manifesto was created.

It is a very short document, but changes the way teams manage projects.

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

- Working software over comprehensive documentation

- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

- Responding to change over following a plan

  

###### Agile principles

1. Satisfy the customer as a priority

2. Welcoming changes

3. Frequent and functional delivery

4. Collaborate daily with the client

5. Support teams and trust

6. Dialog face to face

7. Measure progress with a functional product

8. Adopt a regular and sustainable pace

9. Support technical excellence

10. Make it simple

11. Have a self-organized team

12. Continuous improvement

###### The Agile Mindset

Agile is, above all, a philosophy. Teams must change their mindsets. When teams change the way they work and collaborate, it is more effective rather as when Agile is seen as a tool.



Reasons why Agile is adopted:

- Faster delivery

- Better ability to manage changing priorities

- Increased productivity

- Improve alignment between other departments and IT department

- Software quality

  

###### What is Scrum?

Scrum is a agile project management framework which principle is to be able to modify the direction taken by the project as it progresses.

It was defined in 1995 by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland.

- Scrum team:

  - Product Owner - translates the needs of the customer, has the vision of the project
  - Scrum Master - guarantor of the scrum methodology, coach and conductor
  - Developers - work on the development of the product in incremental way

- Stakeholders

  People that are interested in the work of the team (users, customers, investors, project manager, sales team).

  

###### Product backlog

Is the list of product features to be developed. The list is ordered by priority.

The Product Owner is in charge of creating, prioritizing and updating the backlog (container that gathers all of the productâ€™s functionalities).



###### User Story

The user story is summarized on the product backlog. User story format:

As a [role], I want [functionality], so that [goal].



###### Sprint

The teamâ€™s calendar is broken down in sprints. Each sprint is a full scrum event and contains four other Scrum events: spring planning, dailys crum, sprint review and sprint retrospective.

The goal is to go straight to the main topics and make a decision quickly.



###### Sprint planning

THe team creates the sprint backlog, so the developers select user stories on the advice of the PO. The users stories that have been selected are completed within the time estipulated for the sprint.



###### Daily

Is a 15 minute meeting to inspect the teamâ€™s progress and adopt the action plan as needed.

Sprint review

Scrum team and stakeholders review the sprint results together.

Sprint retrospective

The Scrum team review the work process and think of improvement. Not about the product, but work progress.

What went well?

What went wrong?

What can be improved?

The different roles in Scrum



**Product Owner** - participates in the develpoment of needs and carries the customerâ€™s vision of the final product.

Is the voice of the customer and is in charge of creating the product backlog, prioritizing it and keeping it up-to-date. Anyone on the team can take this role.

**Scrum Master** - a coach who helps the Scrum team understand scrum theory and put it into practice. Ensures that the scrum events take place and are productive. Organizes events and facilitates meetings.

A scrum master helps to remove obstacles during a sprint and protects the team from interruptions that could endanger the sprint.

**Developers** - the member of the team who are committed to performing the tasks necessary to add value to the product each Sprint on a incremental way. They create an action plan to achieve the sprint goal, ensuring quality delivery according to standards defined by the team.

Characteristics of a Scrum team

- Multidisciplinary; it has all the skills necessary for the accomplishment of the project
- Self-managed: it is decided internally who does what, when and how
- Recommended not to exceed 10 members - faster and more efficient communication

The team has to share:

- The same goal

- The same product backlog

- The same PO

  

###### Sprint

The sprint is an event on its own. One sprint equals one iteration.

- All sprints are time-boxed

- There are 5 official scrum events

- Fixed duration of < 1 month

- It is during the sprints that all the work necessary to reach the goal is done

- There is no break between 2 sprints

- During the sprint:

  - The goal of the sprint remains fixed

  - Quality goals cannot be lowered

  - The scoop can be renegotiated with the PO

  - Only the PO can cancel a sprint

    

###### Sprint planning

The whole Scrum team participates on the event. If necessary, other people can be invited.

- Why is this Sprint important?

- What can we do during this Sprint?

- How will the work be done?

  

###### Daily Scrum

Each developer chooses a task he wants to work on and assigns it to themselves. This way, everyone knows what everyone is doing.

- Less than 15 minutes

- Only developers participate (may vary)

- The scrum master can be present but does not need to participate

- The same place and time every single day

- Inspect the teamâ€™s progress towards the sprint goal and adapt the action plan if needed

- Developers are free to use any technique

  

###### Good practices

- Do not interrupt the person speaking
- Talk about facts, avoid overly technical vocabulary
- Dedicate sessions for problem solution after the daily
- Use the questions below:

â€‹	What did I do yesterday?

â€‹	What am I going to do today?

â€‹	What is blocking me?



###### Sprint Review

It is the penultimate event of the sprint

- The team presents the work carried out during the spring to the PO and customers

- The entire scrum team and stakeholders participate in this sprint review

- Live demonstration of the product

- Customers give feedback on the new features delivered and discuss needs or adjusts of priorities

  

###### Sprint Retrospective

The last scrum event

- Discuss the work process

- The team wonder what went well, what can be improved and what went wrong

- Improve the efficiency of the team for the next sprint

- The entire scrum team participates

  

###### Backlog Refinement

It is not part of the official scrum events, but can be used.

- Clarify the elements of the backlog so the team is ready to enter the next sprint
- The entire scrum team participates
- Refine the product backlog, ensure the backlog items are discussed and understood
- The PO updates the backlog before the session



###### Introduction to Kanban

It was created in the 1950s by Taiichi Ono for Toyota.

The goal was to avoid producing large quantities continuously, but to produce according to demand. After a while, it was adapted to IT.

The tasks are distributed in a table according to their status (to do, in progress, validation, finished). It is visual, which promotes collaboration, making easy to spot blocking points.

Kanban differs from Scrum by its simplicity.



###### 4 principles of Kanban

- Start with what you do now

- Agree to pursue evolutionary change

- Respect the current process, roles, responsibilities and titles

- Encourage acts of leadership at all levels

  

###### 5 practices of Kanban

1. Visualize the work

2. Limit the number of tasks in progress

3. Measure and manage progress

4. Establish clear and explicit rules

5. Recognize opportunities for improvement

   

###### Scrum x Kanban

- Scrum is a framework, Kanban is a project management system
- Kanban is lighter when talking about process
- Kanban minimizes the use of events like planning or retrospective like Scrum
- There are fewer meetings in Kanban



###### Kanban Metrics

Lead time

- The time between the creation of a task and its completion, the lifespan of a task as a whole

Cycle Time

- The time between when a task has been assigned to someone and is complete
